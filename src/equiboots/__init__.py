# Detailed Documentation

detailed_doc = """
The `equiboots` library is a fairness-aware model evaluation toolkit designed to
audit performance disparities across demographic groups. It provides robust, 
bootstrapped metrics for binary, multi-class, and multi-label classification, 
as well as regression models. The library supports group-wise performance slicing, 
fairness diagnostics, and customizable visualizations to support equitable AI/ML 
development.

EquiBoots is particularly useful in clinical, social, and policy domains where 
transparency, bias mitigation, and outcome fairness are critical for responsible 
deployment.
