Welcome to the EquiBoots Documentation!
==========================================

.. note::
   This documentation is for ``equiboots`` version ``0.0.0a8``.

EquiBoots is a fairness-aware model evaluation toolkit for auditing performance 
disparities across demographic groups in machine learning models. It provides robust, 
bootstrapped evaluation metrics for binary, multi-class, and multi-label classification 
tasks, as well as regression models.

The library supports:

- Group-wise performance slicing
- Fairness diagnostics and disparity metrics
- Confidence intervals via bootstrapping
- Customizable and publication-ready visualizations
- Statistical tests to assess performance differences

EquiBoots is suited for applications in clinical, social, and 
policy contexts: domains where transparency, bias mitigation, and equitable outcomes 
are essential for responsible AI/ML deployment.
